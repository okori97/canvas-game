# Canvas Game Application

This is a HTML5 canvas game built using mostly JS. This was not for an assignment, soley a passion project to make my first game, however simple.

## To be Completed

If given more time, i would add or complete the following things:

```
- Wrote tests for this game
- Added in different sprites and terrain (have an idea of making it an DBZ inspired game where you catch Dragonballs instead of monsters - Catching 7 would trigger an even)
```
